    <p><strong>The best time to visit the Andaman and Nicobar Islands is between October and May, when the weather is pleasant and ideal for outdoor activities like sightseeing, water sports, and beach excursions. During this time, the average temperature ranges from 20°C to 30°C and humidity is low.</strong></p>
