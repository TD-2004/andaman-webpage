   <p><strong>Ships to Andaman usually depart from Kolkata's Haldia Port or Chennai Port. Haldia Port is closer to Kolkata and may have direct sailings to Port Blair.Reach the designated port (Haldia or Chennai) at least a few hours before departure.
    Plan your transportation to the port in advance, as it might be a distance away from central Kolkata.Ships usually stop at various islands en route, offering passengers a chance to enjoy the scenic beauty of the Bay of Bengal.
